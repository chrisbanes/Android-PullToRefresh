# Pull To Refresh Views for Android

![Screenshot](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh/raw/master/header_graphic.png)

This project aims to provide a reusable Pull to Refresh widget for Android. It was originally based on Johan Nilsson's [library](https://github.com/johannilsson/android-pulltorefresh) (mainly for graphics, strings and animations), but these have been replaced since.

## Features

 * Supports both Pulling Down from the top, and Pulling Up from the bottom (or even both).
 * Animated Scrolling for all devices.
 * Over Scroll supports for devices on Android v2.3+.
 * Currently works with:
 	* **ListView**
 	* **ExpandableListView**
 	* **GridView**
 	* **WebView**
 	* **ScrollView**
 	* **HorizontalScrollView**
 	* **ViewPager**
    * **StaggeredGridView**
 * Integrated End of List Listener for use of detecting when the user has scrolled to the bottom.
 * Maven Support.
 * Indicators to show the user when a Pull-to-Refresh is available.
 * Support for **ListFragment**!
 * Lots of [Customisation](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh/wiki/Customisation) options!

Originally forked from the repository at <https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh>.

## Sample Application
The sample application (the source is in the repository) has been published onto Google Play for easy access:

[![Get it on Google Play](http://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_small.png)](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handmark.pulltorefresh.samples)

## Usage
To begin using the library, please see the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) page.

### Customisation
Please see the [Customisation](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh/wiki/Customisation) page for more information on how to change the behaviour and look of the View.

### Pull Up to Refresh
By default this library is set to Pull Down to Refresh, but if you want to allow Pulling Up to Refresh then you can do so. You can even set the View to enable both Pulling Up and Pulling Down using the 'both' setting. See the [Customisation](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh/wiki/Customisation) page for more information on how to set this.

## Pull Requests

I will gladly accept pull requests for fixes and feature enhancements but please do them in the dev branch. The master branch is for the latest stable code,  dev is where I try things out before releasing them as stable. Any pull requests that are against master from now on will be closed asking for you to do another pull against dev.
